I have created a project that includes a set of scripts and tools that I find useful
for various tasks.

I would like to generate a document (scripts.html) which describes the purpose of
each script in the bin directory. This document should be in html format that is
compatible with conversion to GitHub markdown using the command `pandoc scripts.html
-f html -t markdown -o SCRIPTS.md`.

<%=
  file_patterns = %w[
      .github/**/*
      bin/**/*
      .commitlintrc.yml
      .gitignore
      .markdownlint.yml
      .release-please-manifest.json
      CHANGELOG.md
      LICENSE.txt
      README.md
      release-please-config.json
      *.gemspec
  ]

  project_to_s(file_patterns:)
%>
